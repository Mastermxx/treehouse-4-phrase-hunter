project 4 - OOP Game App

Script by Mark Reijgwart

 I am aiming for a "Exceeds Expectations" grade.
 If I don't get this grade I would like to redo it.
 
 ******************************************
 
 ## Additional Styling
- Changed the win screen color into #78C5CF;
- Changed the losing screen color into #FFAB4C;
- Changed the onscreen keyboard into round buttons.
- Gave the onscreen keys hover state.
- I'd like to only use my ID's for javascript and classes for styling. So I replaced all the ID styling by classes.
- Removed the default button active outline state.
- On the body I added "ser-select: none;". So people can't cheat.
